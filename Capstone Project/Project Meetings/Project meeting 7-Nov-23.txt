Discusson Notes
============
		running linear model on binary explnatory variables
			its possible
			we need to have dummy columns for each response
			e.g.	
				For Gender:
					is-male: isMale Then 1
					is-female: isFemale than 1

		Data dictionary
			giving column names for each descriptive names
			dummy column names

Next steps
============
	Take subset of data (few columns only)
		e.g. is-male,is-female, age
	run regression model, (linear /logstic)
	try to interpret coefficent/model
